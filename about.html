        <p class="myself">My name is Velizar and I come from a small town in central Bulgaria. 
            My passion lies with the creative side of the world despite my master's degree in law. 
            My love towards music came early with listening to various genres around the house. 
            Noone in my family actually does anything related to music, which made it all the more interesting. 
            I created my first track at the age of 15 using Propellerhead- Reason. Later on I developed my interest in guitar and i thought myself how to play. 
            It was after my bachelor's that I decided to invest in developing my passion, thus I signed up for music production classes at MPA in Rotterdam. 
            There I discovered Ableton Live- my go to DAW with which I created Question Reality.

        <p class="company-text">ISCmusicprod is the alias under which I create and release my musical compositions. 
            The "Brand" was established in 2018, when I first registered my music production company in the Netherlands. 
            Originally the company's name was Ivanov Sound Constructions and I decided to call the company ISC as an abbreviation to the full name. 
            After my marketing began the name ISCmusicprod seemed to fit better accross the various platforms. 
            It has since been the brand under which the music has been released and with which people associate me.
